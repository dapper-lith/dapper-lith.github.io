				<a>holy i havent found a use for the blogs really lol! but finally i can make one long form blog post, site has been revamped in little ways<a><br><br>
				<a>first of all and the biggest, yeah yeah feel free to shame me for this i should be ashamed of myself as i had to use an llm for this after i couldnt find anyone who could help me, you can now finally link directly to pages! (requires JS to be enabled) the url shouold update respectively with the current page youre ntering aswell (by appending /?page=filename.htm to the url)</a><br><br>
				<a>second of all, i redesigned the gallery, now its 4 columns instead of 5, threw in a screenshot category, added lith's commentary, made it look cleaner. should be a better ux now in gallery</a><br><br>
				<a>third, added a limited mobile support. if you make your window too thin or get the phone in a portrait orientation and then refresh, it should lock into the "mobile layout", it doesnt update live due to framesets work (from what ive researched atleast) so a refresh is nescessary everytime you want to switch orientations. im sure you'd still rather it be locked in a mobile layout than no mobile support at all<a><br><br>
				<a>and various minor changes, added commision info to homepage as i want to finally try those. so sorry if im inexperienced about it all, added a favicon, added an "offsite link" icon to respective links</a>
