				<a>thanks for visiting this little site! i made it really just to have a  place to put up my meaningless little stuff like my artwork or smaller achievements, now im not really good at doing html or css, i had a lot of help from toiletflusher!</a><br><br>
				<a>as of right now this site is pretty empty and i have nothing to show off except for my old stuff, and im still thinking how to improve this site to be better than it is right now. you MIGHT be able to access this site on older browsers, just fonts and the sidebar wont have the gradients (css on those two aspects) but should be entirely usable. didnt make this site with mobile in mind and i dont know how to make it work for mobile with my current 'dark' techniques (ideally would be to make the sidebar a topbar in portrait mode on mobile)</a><br><br>
				<a>either way, hope you have a nice day, fellow visitor on the internet!</a>
