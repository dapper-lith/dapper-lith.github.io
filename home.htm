				<a>note that this site uses framesets, so if you want to hotlink to a page, append /?page=file.htm at the end of url, though the only minimal js should take care of that on its own</a><br><br>

				<a>hoo, welcome to NORWAY! and jeez, its a miles different culture than ukraine, seeing lots of mixed races, seeing a lot of black people, other ukrainian fellows and arabs. kind of glad i was an isolated person who only spoke to my friends online since that really just helped me sharpen my english knowledge since like almost everyone here knows english as a 2nd language. the actual ride itself started out great, and ended agonizingly. if i had rough estimates, about 4.5 full sleepless days of just riding and exploring on foot ~16 hour train, ~10 hour walking around in kyiv, ~26 hours of driving a bus to poland, ~24+ hours of sitting in the airport (since we assumed the bus would get delayed for hours at the border so we booked the plane for a day ahead) and then finally ~2 hours of flying on the plane. passing through airport security made me REALLY paranoid and scared it might aswell have just traumatized me, we had to rearrange our baggage several times and even if everything passed through fine, i felt like just dropping and crying by that point, but oh well atleast its all in the past and im in a newer, better place </a><font size="-1" color="gray">(31-10-2025)</font>
