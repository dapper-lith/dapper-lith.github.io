				<a>hihihi!! thanks for visiting this abomination of a personal site! reminder to refresh without cache every once in a while (ctrl+f5) every time it updates</a><br>
				<a>LIMITED mobile support now included! everytime you switch between portrait and landscape and refresh it <i>should</i> lock into the appropriate layout<a><br>
				<a>note that this site uses framesets, so if you want to hotlink to a page, append /?page=file.htm at the end of url, though the only minimal js should take care of that on its own</a><br><br>
				<a>i may accept commisions (CLOSED AT THE MOMENT! sorry! also the sheet needs tweaks right now), </a><a href="./misc/commsheet.htm">refer to this commision sheet</a><a>. i'm taking paypal and $XMR (Monero). you might hit me up on discord (dapper_lith) if you want to take a commision.</a><br><a>if you just want to donate me for whatever reason, you can do so too!</a><br>

				<a>hooooo boy, where do i even begin? soon ill be moving out in about 2 and a half weeks as of writing this, which means ill leave my desktop behind (as its REALLY heavy to bring around) which means the quality of my artworks might decrease, atleast in the background department as i wont be able to use any intensive game for screenshots, and my phone's camera is terrible to draw over, so for now im able to do only like 1-2 commisions IF i get them, and then it could possibly be a hiatus, or an era of badly made artworks. but hopefully itll be much better than being out here in ukraine. besides, i might really need this in my life. i DID want to move out to EU eventually for the friends and to finally get something fresh again </a><font size="-1" color="gray">(17-09-2025)</font>
