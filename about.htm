				<a>i am <b>lith</b>, you'll commonly see me online as <b>dapper_lith</b>, originally this username was created cause my oc was literally </a><a href=".\images\assets\dapper gigalith.jpg" target="_top">a gigalith from pokemon with a fedora.</a><br><br>
				<a>i would say that im a lazy person overall, cant focus on any work while focusing on things that truly interest me is really easy.</a><br>
				<a>sometimes i draw (check </a><a href="./gallery.htm">gallery</a><a>!), rarely i 3d model, but most of the time i just shamelessly play games (i love rain world, and probably will for the next few months, please check it out! its absolutely awesome and is drm-free!). from this page alone, you can definitely tell that i like to write a lot, but theres REALLY nothing on the table, lots of words but theres really nothing to it. this entire page so far can be summarized as "im lith, my oc is a gigalith, im lazy, i play games, yaps a lot" and no one would really care. sometimes i wish i could talk as much in an actual physical social interaction (or a voicechat in that matter) as i type out here though...</a><br><br><br>
				<a><b>USELESS FACTS ABOUT ME (as of june 2025)!</b> i own a (partially) broken psp and a broken ds lite. i use a crt monitor on a daily basis (5:4, syncmaster 793df). favourite slugcat? <b>all of them.</b> i think steam is a better art sharing platform than twitter is (screw algorithms that favour paying or already well established users!)</a>
