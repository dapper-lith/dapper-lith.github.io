				<a>okay so here, i really. REALLY wanted a slugcat oc for... whatever reason. so i decided "why not brainstorm like 3 of them" and then choose one, thats how you ended up with these. the "flavours" are really just a fancy word for themes in this one. ALSO here you can see me trying out new artstyles, where its sort of like a paper cutout.</a><br><br>
				<a>gigalith flavoured - named lith (obviously, since its basically what i am) honestly, self explainatory. barely resembling gigalith scug, no mouth, it isnt a stylistic choice to not draw one, could use sticky notes for expressions though</a><br><br>
				<a>paper pirate flavoured - no name, this one is... unique, basically theyre made out of paper, and is like an actual paper cutout glued together. i thought of gifting this to my friends but i dont know about it, maybe ill do something with it eventually. i dont know what else to talk about this one</a><br><br>
				<a>frost flavoured - also no name, but i would like ideas on this one!! honestly i really love how this one turned out, though one of my friends pointed out it was similliar to friend from the solace mod and honestly, i can see why. both are fluffy, related to snow, and cyan. though mine is bipedal like other slugcats rather than quadruped, with blue eyes, dark blue arms and legs and an icicle on their back. so it isnt exactly a copycat, just really similliar and i think its a funny coincidence though</a>
