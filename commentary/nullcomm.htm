				<a>my first ever commision! and its from one of my friends, NULLderef! they pretty much told me to go wild with it, but preferably with a snow theme so here you have this. decided since "hey, this is my first commision, he pretty much gave me a tip" and "were friends anyway" decided to make it a really basic 3 frame loop. not that good but honestly id say its nice. also the ALT just has black/purple thigh highs on it, as per request by null</a><br><br>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/femboycat.gay">you should probably go check them out though!<img src="../images/offsite.gif"></a><a> i think theyre the most active on bsky, the one platform i abandoned</a><br><br>
				<a>"why doesnt the 'enlargened' main image doesnt link to a gif and you instead put apngs as alts?" i thought the animation could be a little irritating to the eyes with snow, and gif compression REALLY ate this one compared to the saint drinking one</a>
