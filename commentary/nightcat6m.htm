				<a>this one... might be a little offensive or controversial to some in the terms of the background. lets just say i wanted to build a farm here. despite that it was my first time of trying the artstyle of putting unrelated things things in minecraft, mainly slugcats! also late realisation but i think i was partially inspired by 'foxes in love' webcomics for the artstyle, and partially inspired by one of my friend editing things in into games</a>
