				<a>DISCLAIMER: I REALLY RECCOMEND YOU SUPPORT THE RAIN WORLD DEVS! im personally not against piracy, infact with how sh*t the world nowadays is, im in favour of piracy. rain world is honestly an exception to that though since its a fun, drm-free game with hours of content in it where devs surely put in a lot of love and is honestly worth buying (give rain meadow a shot if you get to buy it!). hell its even avalible on </a><a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/RainWorld/733070">gamejolt<img src="../images/offsite.gif"></a><a> of all things! thats a niche bit of trivia for you, only 351 views on the gamejolt page as of writing this for a game which has atleast 100k estimated players if we count every member in their discord as a unique person who has played rain world</a><br><br>
				<a>i will not name the sites in the background but good job if you know what they are and give yourself a pat on the back, now with that pointless yap aside, commentary on both of the artworks</a><br>
				<a>i still dont know what to name the blue frost scug oc, but you can see im experimenting with the flat, "paper cutout"-esque artstyle, i dont really know how to describe it. also theres a </a><a target="_top" href="..\images\artwork\frostpiratelegaledition.png">"""legal edition""" variant of the frost oc scug pirate, whose background is adobe's ridiculous cancellation fees</a><br>
				<a>the inv/enot/sofanthiel/??? pirate variant was done as per request of one of my friends, and the pose is infact, a jojo reference (more specifically josuke's pose)</a>
