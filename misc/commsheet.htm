				<a>+$5 - no signature (if you dont want that 'dapper_lith' text hiding away somewhere in the piece for... whatever reason)</a><br>
				<a>+$Name Your Price - if you want to give me a tip!</a><br><br>
				<a>you can choose free of charge between the lined, but shaded style as seen on the saint artwork, or the flat, paper cutout-esque style seen in my pirate artworks</a><br><br>
				<a>WILL NOT do: NSFW, vore, inflation or any fetish content, it should be common sense.</a><br>
				<a>MAYBE hesitantly will do: micro/macro or just extreme size difference content, as long as it isnt used for fetish purposes or weird me out, like im fine with drawing huge critters overall</a><br>
				<a>CAN do: ocs, anthro (i mean, ill try), feral</a><br><br>
				<a>know that im... not good at drawing more realistic or humanoid creatures</a><br>
				<a>-id really, REALLY prefer it if you use monero for payment, but paypal is an option</a><br>
				<a>-i will send you wip progress over on discord (dapper_lith !!! im most active there than twitter dms or anything else) to see if you need things tweaked up</a><br>
				<a>-partial payment after the wip sketch is done</a><br>
				<a>-at a VERY minimum, the piece can be done from 3 days, at max it can stretch from a week to a month (especially if its an animation, where the timeframe might be larger, as i still havent figured out a good workflow)</a><br>
				<a>-no refunds after pre-payment</a><br>
				<a>-when paying extra, please mention what youre paying for (e.g. 'oh hey! id like to commision you for a simple flat background piece, no signature, animation loop! and ill tip you $5 if i really like the finished product!')</a><br>
				<a>-if you want, you can ask me to use the style as seen on my "pirates" artwork or the lined artworks (as seen on pretty much everything-minecraft in my gallery, otherwise ill pick whatever would look best)</a>
				<a>-i have full right to reject something that i feel uncomfortable drawing</a><br>
				<a>-exported as png, resolution can be up to 2000x2000px, animations are exported as gif and apng</a>
				<a>-i might post the finished commision on my gallery with buyer's username</a><br><br>
