				<a>this tab is for smaller, pointless and low effort posts, status updates and etc, the kind of posts youd see from me on twitter. at the end of the month (if there were any posts) it would be archived so it didnt cumulate into one looong page known to mankind</a>

				<a>hooooo boy, where do i even begin? soon ill be moving out in about 2 and a half weeks as of writing this, which means ill leave my desktop behind (as its REALLY heavy to bring around) which means the quality of my artworks might decrease, atleast in the background department as i wont be able to use any intensive game for screenshots, and my phone's camera is terrible to draw over, so for now im able to do only like 1-2 commisions IF i get them, and then it could possibly be a hiatus, or an era of badly made artworks. but hopefully itll be much better than being out here in ukraine. besides, i might really need this in my life. i DID want to move out to EU eventually for the friends and to finally get something fresh again </a><font size="-1" color="gray">(17-09-2025)</font></br>

				<a>follow up from the previous miniblog and a somewhat lengthy rant, i have never seen a site with a worse user experience than furaffinity, hell maybe even scientists couldnt find anything worse. to list it all well... the classic layout barely works, why keep it an option? you cannot even upload anything while having classic layout on (not atleast using chromium). it reminds me of the mobile discord situation back from like 2023-2024, the layout is so confusing i could barely find anything. some things dont make sense, why are (broken) site layouts in the account settings and not site settings? banner and pfp settings could be easily merged into user page & profile info. for a while i couldnt find a tag blacklist page and i thought you had to individually go on posts and hit the little plus button to blacklist tags until i just found out theyre in the same page where you configure your profile info. its just these little things that make me tick, now excuse me while i bleach my eyes trying to blacklist tags before i found that out </a><font size="-1" color="gray">(30-08-2025)</font></br>

				<a>my friends told me that if i want to expand my reach, i should make accounts on... furaffinity and itaku. i dont know much about the latter but the former would make me really awkwardly embarrased at and quite frankly it makes me embarassed to even speak up about it here but i suppose you have to do anything to expand your reach to a bigger public, since id get NOWHERE if i just kept it to this site and xitter alone </a><font size="-1" color="gray">(30-08-2025)</font></br>
